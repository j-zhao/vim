# vim

**Author**: Jesse Zhao

This is my `vimrc` set up.  I have a love/hate relationship with Vim, most of the time I spend more time trying to tweak my setup to try to be productive than the time it saves from my changes.  I primarily use this as my text editor when I get sick/bored of Sublime.  Use at your own risk!
